    <h2>Aloo means “potato” and paratha means “flatbread” in Hindi, so the name is quite telling: aloo paratha is an unleavened whole wheat flatbread stuffed with a savory, spiced, mashed potato filling.

        Though there are many variations of stuffed paratha, many folks like aloo ke parathe above all others. In Punjabi families, parathas are made with lots of love and affection, not to mention lots of ghee and homemade butter (makhan). If you lean towards a healthier lifestyle, you can easily opt to roast aloo paratha in oil and serve them with curd (plain yogurt) instead of butter.</h2>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough made from whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Mashed potato stuffing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b><u>Steps</u></b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll them into balls.</li>
        <li>Then divide the potato filling into 4 parts and shape into balls. Potato balls should be about 1½ times larger than the dough balls.</li>
        <li>Roll dough ball into a 3” circle. Place a filling ball in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap it around the potato filling. Repeat to make all six balls. Let the filled balls settle three to four minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile heat heavy skillet on medium high heat until moderately hot. To test, sprinkle water on the skillet. If the water sizzles right away, the skillet is ready.</li>
        <li>Press the filled ball lightly on dry whole wheat flour from both sides.</li>
        <li>Using a rolling pin, roll the balls lightly to make six-inch circles, keeping the sealed side of the balls on top. If the dough sticks to the rolling pin or rolling surface, lightly dust the parathas with dry flour.
        </li>
        <li>Oil the skillet and place the paratha on the skillet. When the paratha starts to change color and begins to puff up, flip it over. You will notice some olden-brown spots.</li>
        <li>After a few seconds, drizzle one teaspoon of oil over the paratha, and spread with spatula. Flip the paratha again and lightly press the puffed areas with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Flip again and press with a spatula making sure the paratha is golden-brown on both sides. Repeat for the remaining parathas.</li>
        <li>Parathas are best served hot and crispy. They will be soft if not served hot. If you are not going to serve them right away, cool them on a wire rack to keep them from getting soggy.</li>
        <li>Parathas can be kept unrefrigerated for up to two days wrapped in aluminum foil or in a covered container. For later use, parathas can be refrigerated three to four days or frozen for up to a month. Re-heat using a skillet or oven.</li>
    </ol>
